  <p>Pre-Processing Pipeline for Receipts</p>
</h3>


This repo implements a document pre-processing pipeline for receipts. Currently, the pipeline is under development. The pipeline assumes the receipts are in PDF or image formats (JPG, PNG).

The API is hosted at `https://api.unstructured.io`.

## :coffee: Getting Started 

* Using `pyenv` to manage virtualenv's is recommended
    * Mac install instructions:
        * `brew install pyenv-virtualenv`
        * `pyenv install 3.8.15`
    
    Create a virtualenv to work in and activate it, e.g. for one named `receipts`:
    
    `pyenv  virtualenv 3.8.15 receipts` <br />
    `pyenv activate receipts`

* Run `make install` 
* Start a local jupyter notebook server with `make run-jupyter` <br />
    **OR** <br />
    just start the fast-API locally with `make run-web-app`
    
#### Extracting Structured Text from an Receipt Image
After API starts, you can extract the elements of Receipt files with the command:
```
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8000/receipts/v0.1.0/receipts' \
  -F 'files=@<your_receipt_file>' \
  | jq -C . | less -R
```

### Generating Python files from the pipeline notebooks

You can generate the FastAPI APIs from your pipeline notebooks by running `make generate-api`.
